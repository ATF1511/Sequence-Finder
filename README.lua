Hi
So uhhh
This script does what the title says. It can't handle squares and square roots and always prints it out in the form:
Xn +/- Y 
Like it works I guess
Also it has very weird variable names but I didn't want to mess up any code that it might be added into.
It doesn't need any imports to work so it SHOULD work in any python script.

You will need to input the first two numbers of the sequence for it to work but I might make one that lets you do any two numbers. 
Idk I've just had a horrible day and don't feel like it right now.

Also,
You may be wondering why this is README.lua and not README.md .
Eh I just think it's funny.
I will probably make it for more languages... shouldn't be to complicated to transfer it to actual lua... right?

Bye lol
